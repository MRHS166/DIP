#ImageProcessor
A modular Python script for performing common image processing tasks using OpenCV, including loading images, adjusting brightness and contrast, blurring, denoising, edge detection, and feature extraction using SIFT.

#ðŸ“¦ Features
-âœ… Load images with format validation

-âœ… Adjust brightness and contrast

-âœ… Apply Gaussian blur

-âœ… Apply Non-local Means Denoising

-âœ… Perform Canny edge detection

-âœ… Extract features using SIFT descriptors

-âœ… Save processed images to disk

#ðŸ›  Requirements
Python 3.6+

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Install the required packages using:


pip install opencv-python numpy
For SIFT to work, you may need the opencv-contrib-python package:


pip install opencv-contrib-python
#ðŸš€ Usage
Run the Script
Place your image in a known directory and edit the path in the main() function:


input_path = "/content/images (1).jpeg"
Then run the script:


python image_processor.py
Output
The script processes the image and saves:

Brightness/contrast adjusted image

Gaussian blurred image

Denoised image

Canny edge map

Each image is saved using the original filename with a suffix (e.g., image_adjusted.jpg).
